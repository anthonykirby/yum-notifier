# yum-notifier

*yum-notifier* is a simple application that appears in the system tray, and checks YUM for updates

Written because yumex (Fedora) doesn't handle suspend/resume, getting its knickers in a twist, dying and requiring manual clean-up.  And for the interest of writing a simple GTK2 program.
